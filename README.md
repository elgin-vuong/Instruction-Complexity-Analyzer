# Instruction Complexity Analyzer

Designed an AI tool to predict instructional task complexity, aimed at supporting users with executive function challenges in the AI4ALL program accelerator


## Problem Statement <!--- do not change this line -->

Executive functions are the cognitive skills that help us plan, focus, and manage tasks. A significant challenge for individuals with conditions like ADHD or cognitive fog is "task initiation," where gauging the mental energy required for a task can be overwhelming. Not knowing if a set of instructions will be simple or complex can be a major barrier to starting.


## Key Results <!--- do not change this line -->

(UPDATE IN README.md)
Enumerate the main results of this project in a list and describe them.

*EXAMPLE:*
1. *Recorded over 1,000 unique prompts and their responses generated by ChatGPT*
2. *Identified three biases in ChatGPT's responses*
   - *When prompted about this world event*
   - *When prompted about this field of science*
   - *When prompted about this political party*


## Methodologies <!--- do not change this line -->

(UPDATE IN README.md)

*EXAMPLE:*
*To accomplish this, we utilized the OpenAI API to interact with ChatGPT, and we designed a custom Python script to generate diverse prompts and collect corresponding responses. The data was then processed and analyzed using pandas, enabling us to detect patterns and biases in the AI model's outputs.*
*Engineered a Python script to generate over 1,000 prompts and elicit their responses from ChatGPT, utilizing pandas to collect the data. When prompted for solutions to this specific relevant crisis, nearly 80% of ChatGPT's responses promoted a certain worldview.*
